Boston was originally called “Trimountain” given its location beside three hills on the mouth of the Charles River.  Two of the three hills, Mt. Vernon and Pemberton were leveled in the early 1800s to help fill in Boston’s Back Bay.  The only remaining hill is Beacon Hill; site of the Charles Bulfinch designed State House.  The Tremont name is also memorialized today in Tremont Street, which runs along the Boston Common in front of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.";
